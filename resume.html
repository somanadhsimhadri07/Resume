    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE:</h2>
    <h3>Internship: Real-time embedded systems with Robotics - June 2023 - July 2023</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The real-time mini spider robot project is aimed at designing and developing a small, multi-leggedrobot that mimics the movement and behaviour of a spider</li>
        <li>Powered by a real-time control system, this robot is equipped with sensors and actuators that enable itto navigate different terrains, react to environmental changes, and execute specific tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project: Utilizing electronic textiles for wearable antennas in RF communications and medicalapplications - Dec 2023 - May 2024</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The main idea of a textile antenna with embroidery project is to integrate antenna functionality intofabric through the use of conductive threads and embroidery techniques.</li>
        <li>This allows for the creation of wearable technology, smart textiles, or even functional clothing itemsthat can transmit or receive wireless signals while maintaining a visually appealing and comfortabledesign.</li>
        <li>Such textile antennas have applications in areas like IoT, medical monitoring, and communicationsystems for on-the-go connectivity.</li>
